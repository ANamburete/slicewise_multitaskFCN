# Multi-task FCN weights
Model descriptions and pre-trained weights for slice-wise multitask network

This repository contains the descriptions of all models explored in our publication:

Namburete, A.I.L., Xie, Weidi, et al. Fully-Automated Alignment of 3D Fetal Neurosonography Images onto a Canonical Reference Space using Multi-task FCNs. submitted to MedIA

Please acknowledge this publication if using these weights in your work.

The models were implemented in Python, and trained using the keras library running on tensorflow. 
The model architectures are provided in models.py, and their respective weights are saved in .hdf5 files. A minimal example is provided in the folder named '\toy_example\'. After setup, simply run the 'example.py' script to test.
